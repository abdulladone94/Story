The 20 Minute Mindset
Once you open your house door without a solid work plan for your evening, youâ€™ve already lost that evening. 
The way to capitalise on this evolutionary productivity hack is to have the 20 minute mindset. If you get home with the intention to just work for 20 minutes on your project, be it your start-up or whatever else you want to work on, you can trick your brain into capitulating. 20 minutes is such a short amount of time that your brain will view it as low commitment. This mindset is important.
