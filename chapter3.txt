The Dreaded Post-Prandial Dip
That’s the fancy-pants word for that sleepy, can’t be arsed feeling you get after lunch, also known as the food coma. The scientific explanation for this phenomenon is the insulin spike that occurs after a significant amount of carbohydrate intake. Insulin is secreted in response to carbs and gets your body ready for digestion related activities.
To be productive, we really want to avoid this. The weapon of choice most people choose is caffeine. This is the wrong approach. Because you’ll take yourself over the optimal caffeine level and will inevitably crash harder when you stop taking caffeine in order to sleep. The correct answer is frequent, low carb, high protein meals and snacks around lunch time.
