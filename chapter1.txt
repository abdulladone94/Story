Caffeine Titration
Caffeine is an age old stimulant this is well known for its efficacy as”liquid motivation”. But, any pro coffee drinker will know that if you take too much of it you will be bouncing off the walls and if you under-dose then you won’t get the full effect. As with any drug, caffeine too has a half life, meaning that it is slowly being metabolised by your body which leads to your caffeine crash.
