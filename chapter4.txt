Elaborative interrogation
Asking questions can be immensely helpful when trying to learn – and retain – information for your exams. After you learn something ask yourself, “why is this fact true?” or “how do I know it is true?”
Research has proven this will help you consolidate and remember the fact through encouraging you to use the new information you’ve learned together with things you already know, improving your memory for the new info by tying it to your baseline of knowledge.
